log4net-loggly
==============

Custom log4net appenders for importing logging events to loggly. Itâ€™s asynchronous and will send logs in the background without blocking your application. Check out Loggly's [.Net logging documentation](https://www.loggly.com/docs/net-logs/) to learn more.

<strong>Note:</strong> This library also has a support for .NET Core applications. Please see the section <strong>[.NET Core Support](README.md#net-core-support)</strong> below.

Download log4net-loggly package from NuGet. Use the following command.

    Install-Package log4net-loggly

Add the following code in your web.config to configure LogglyAppender in your application
```
    <configSections>
      <section name="log4net" type="log4net.Config.Log4NetConfigurationSectionHandler, log4net" />
    </configSections>
    <log4net>
      <root>
        <level value="ALL" />
        <appender-ref ref="LogglyAppender" />
      </root>
      <appender name="LogglyAppender" type="log4net.loggly.LogglyAppender, log4net-loggly">
        <rootUrl value="https://logs-01.loggly.com/" />
        <inputKey value="your-customer-token" />
		<tag value="your-custom-tag" /> 
		<logicalThreadContextKeys value="lkey1,lkey2" /> <!-- optional -->
		<globalContextKeys value="gkey1,gkey2" /> <!-- optional -->
      </appender>
    </log4net>
```    
To send **GlobalContext** and **LogicalThreadContext** properties in your log you need define the list of used properties in the configuration. 

For GlobalContext Properties use 
```<globalContextKeys value="gkey1,gkey2" />```

For LogicalThreadContext Properties 
```<logicalThreadContextKeys value="lkey1,lkey2" />```


You can also use **layout** with in the Config to render logs according to your Pattern Layouts

     <layout type="log4net.Layout.PatternLayout">
         <conversionPattern value="%date [%thread] %-5level %logger %message" />
     </layout>

By default, library uses Loggly /bulk end point (https://www.loggly.com/docs/http-bulk-endpoint/). To use /inputs endpoint, add the following configuration in config file.

```
<logMode value="inputs" />
```


Add the following entry in your AssemblyInfo.cs
```
[assembly: log4net.Config.XmlConfigurator(Watch = true)]
```

Alternatively, you can add the following code in your Main method or in Global.asax file

```
log4net.Config.XmlConfigurator.Configure();
```

Create an object of the Log class using LogManager

    var logger = LogManager.GetLogger(typeof(Class));
    
Send logs to Loggly using the following code

```  
    logger.Info("log message");
```

<strong>For Console Application</strong>

You should add the following statement at the end of your Main method as the log4net-loggly library is asynchronous so there needs to be time for the threads the complete logging before the application exits.

```
Console.ReadKey();
```
### <strong>.NET Core Support:</strong>

<strong>Prerequisites:</strong>

- Since this library support .NET Core target framework 2.0, make sure you are using either version 15.3.0 or higher of Visual Studio IDE 2017 or Visual Studio Code.

- You must have installed the .NET Core 2.0 SDK and Runtime environment to develop and run your .NET Core 2.0 applications.

- You may also have to install the .NET Core cross-platform development workload (in the Other Toolsets section). Please see the more details [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/windows-prerequisites?tabs=netcore2x).

Once you are done with the environment setup, now you are all set to create your application in .NET Core target framework 2.0. Please follow the points below-

- If you are using <strong>Visual Studio 2017 IDE</strong> then you can create a new .NET Core project by selecting <strong>New Project</strong> from <strong>File</strong> menu.

- <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong> users can create a new project by running the below command on the project workspace terminal-

```
dotnet new console -o Application_Name
```

The <strong>dotnet</strong> command creates a new application of type <strong>console</strong> for you. The <strong>-o</strong> parameter creates a directory named <strong><Application_Name></strong> where your app is stored, and populates it with the required files.

- If you are using <strong>Visual Studio 2017 IDE</strong> then you have to install the package <strong>log4net-loggly</strong> into your project from <strong>NuGet</strong> by running the command on <strong>Package Manager Console</strong> as shown below-

```
Install-Package log4net-loggly
```

- If you are using <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong> then run the below command on the terminal to install the <strong>log4net-loggly</strong> package.

```
dotnet add package log4net-loggly
```

- Now when you create an applicaton in .NET Core, there is no App.config file exist already in the project so you have to create one.

    (a) For <strong>Visual Studio 2017</strong> users, you should right click on your project and create a <strong>Application Configuration File</strong> "App.config" on the root level of your project.

  (b) For <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong> users, you should simply create the same configuration file on the the folder structure where your another files exists.

- You should simply add the below configuration code in your App.config file to configure LogglyAppender in your application. Make sure the <strong>configSections</strong> block is the first element of the configuration in app.config. This is a requirement set by .NET.

```
<configSections>
      <section name="log4net" type="log4net.Config.Log4NetConfigurationSectionHandler, log4net" />
    </configSections>
    <log4net>
      <root>
        <level value="ALL" />
        <appender-ref ref="LogglyAppender" />
      </root>
      <appender name="LogglyAppender" type="log4net.loggly.LogglyAppender, log4net-loggly">
        <rootUrl value="https://logs-01.loggly.com/" />
        <inputKey value="your-customer-token" />
		<tag value="your-custom-tag" /> 
		<logicalThreadContextKeys value="lkey1,lkey2" /> <!-- optional -->
		<globalContextKeys value="gkey1,gkey2" /> <!-- optional -->
      </appender>
    </log4net>
```

<strong>Note: If you are using Visual Studio 2017 IDE then your application will not be able to read configurations from this App.config file until you do the following-</strong>

- Right click on your <strong>App.config</strong> file from Solution Explorer, go to <strong>Properties</strong> and select the <strong>Copy to Output Directory</strong> to <strong>Copy always</strong>, click Apply and hit the OK button.

 If you are using <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong> then you don't need to do the extra settings for App.config file.

- As compare to .NET Frameworks, in .NET Core you don't need any AssemblyInfo.cs file to add the below code in-

```
[assembly: log4net.Config.XmlConfigurator(Watch = true)]
```

The above code line allows the application to read the configuration from App.config file. In .NET Core applications, we will be reading the configuartions in a different way which is stated below-

- Add the following code inside the main method of your application file i.e. Program.cs-

```
var logRepository = LogManager.GetRepository(Assembly.GetEntryAssembly());
log4net.Config.XmlConfigurator.Configure(logRepository, new FileInfo("App.config"));
```
After adding the above code you can simply create an object of the Log class using LogManager and start logging any plaintext, exceptions, or JSON events as shown below-

```
var logger = LogManager.GetLogger(typeof(Class));
//Send plaintext
logger.Info("your log message");

//Send an exception
logger.Error("your log message", new Exception("your exception message"));

//Send a JSON object
var items = new Dictionary<string,string>();
items.Add("key1","value1");
items.Add("key2", "value2");
logger.Info(items);
```

Running the application in <strong>Visual Studio 2017 IDE</strong> is easy since you just need to click on the <strong>Start</strong> button to run your application.

If you are using <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong> then you have to run the below command on the terminal to run your .NET Core application-

```
dotnet run
```

And that's it. After doing this, you will see your .NET Core application logs flowing into Loggly.


<strong>Added handling for LoggingEvent properties</strong>

Support for properties tied to a specific event and not a ThreadContext which is shared across the entire thread.

<strong>Added test cases project</strong> 

- Added unit test cases project in library to test consistency for new feature.

- User can select test cases project in Visual Studio and can simply run all test cases from Test Explorer.
